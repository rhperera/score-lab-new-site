						<h2>Google Summer of Code 2016</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Welcome to the SCoRe Lab Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2016 project ideas page. We are a dynamic and enthusiastic nonprofit research
						group pioneering in Internet of Things (IOT), Embedded Systems, Computer Security and 'Wireless Adhoc and Sensor Networks' and is
						one of the best groups in South Asia. We are based in the University of Colombo School of Computing, Sri Lanka. This is the first time
						that we are participating in the GSoC, we will use this page to develop possible project ideas that have on the above mentioned areas.
						Please note that anyone who is interested can participate in this process. You do not have to be a GSoC student or mentor to suggest
						possible project ideas. You can also talk to us about possible project ideas and we are happy to improve or heip you with them.
						Please keep in mind that projects need to be realistically something that is able to be functionally completed by a student working
						full time for about eight weeks. Thanks!

				<h2>Proposal 2 : Auto-Installer and Easy Deployments for OpenDF</h2>
				<p> Auto installer should install the db script and create an admin account with the details provided by the user. It should also display the User Agreement and get user agreed to the terms before initialization. This includes setting up organisation details, report header templates etc.</p>
				<p> Since this task is little bit easy, we like you to work on Easy Deployments task also. The ideas is to use <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to let anyone spawn an OpenDF configured VM within minutes. What has to be done is, write some shell scripts to install needed platforms( Git, Java, Glashfish, etc ) on top of a Linux distro and exposing the application to the outer environment. We can shre this Vagrant configuration on <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/share/">Vagrant Share</a>. Then anyone who likes to use OpenDF can simply use <code>vegrant up</code> command and visit the url from the user's browser once the VM successfully started

				<h2>Proposal 5 : Test Automation for OpenDF</h2>
				<p>GSoC is not only about developing, it is also about testing! We need a mechanism to automate the functional testing, something like Selenium may be ideal ( Cucumber test framework may also be a good fit ). If we can have a test script, a continious intrigation tool can execute these tests for every build. Therefor the task is to come up with a suitable test automation mechanism and start writing the test scripts. ( You can refer the OpenDF's test documents to get an idea of test cases. )

				<h2>Proposal 11 : Redesign Tikiri-DB</h2>
				<p>
					TikiriDB is a database abstraction layer to enable a query interface to acquire required data in highly efficient manner. After setting up the sensor network with TikiriDB It is possible to gather data without having the knowledge of programming sensor nodes. TikiriDB will provide a query language which is more similar to conventional query language with additional syntax to comply with sensor network environment. TikiriDB system is composed in three parts on is installed in sensor nodes, one is installed in base-stations and the other is installed in computer connected with the base-station. The application installed in computer will provide an API to connect the your application with the database. Query processor of TikiriDB is located at sensor node. The other part which installed in base-station node will mainly handle the routing of the queries. In this project main objective is make TikiriDB compatible with newer Contiki vision.

		<div id="IoTDatastore">
			<h2>Proposal 12 : IoT Datastore powered by Distributed Software Transactional memory</h2>

			<p>One of the challenges associated with the internet of things is figuring out where to put all that data. If you have dozens of connected devices talking to the cloud youâ€™ve got to think about where that data lives, how to normalize it and how to grant others access to it so it becomes useful. The goal of this project is to optimize read/write operations in such data store which can be used as a platform to build concurrent systems. Software Transactional Memories (STMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm to develop concurrent applications. By relishing the programmer from the burden of managing locks or other low-level concurrency control mechanisms, the reliability of the code is increased and the software development time significantly shortened.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<b>Deliverables: </b>
				<ul>
					<li>Model IoT data in single data framework (You can use existing tools)</li>
					<li>Implement STM on cluster nodes which can plug into above framework</li>
					<li>Solve conflicts between STMs running on different nodes of the cluster which requires nodes to obtain exclusive access to the datastore during the commit phase</li>
					<li>Build a debug tool to explore performance metrics</li>
				</ul>

						The process of gain superuser access to Android file system root folder is known as device rooting.  There is no general way to gain root access in all Android smartphones as it is highly coupled with vendor, Android version, build number, kernel and model.

This could be done by maintaining a hash value repository of binary files in Android platform. At the moment there is no such up-to-date repository available internet (NSRL does not contain comprehensive list of hashes of Android applications).
After categorization, the module should enable analysis of binary files. Analysis can start by identifying permissions requested by the application.

					<h2>Proposal 16: Top-k publish/subscribe model for intelligent Taxi allocation</h2>

<p>Publish/subscribe systems are widely recognized in processing continuous queries over data
streams and are augmented by algorithms coming from the field of data stream processing. Existing functions which are capable of matching publications & subscriptions in state-of-the-art publish/subscribe systems are depended on a stateless function which provides only a Boolean decision on whether a given publication is to be notified to relevant subscriber or not. But in such systems, the large quantity of received publications may be considered as a sort of spam, while a system that delivers too few publications might be recognized as non-working.
We have implemented an advanced publish/subscribe matching model to control the unpredictable number of delivered publications over a continuous data-stream, where at a given time t our model limits the number of delivered publications by parameter k, while ranks them within a size w of sliding window. A general scoring mechanism is exploited where publications get scored against personalized user subscription spaces based on the relevancy. We adopt an inverted-list data structure to index the subscription space to enhance the efficiency of matching process. Also we focus on the problem of selecting the k-most diverse items from a relevant result set, in a dynamic setting where Top-k results change over time. An incremental indexing mechanism is proposed for handling streaming publications that is based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to diversify Top-k results continuously. Our prototype model is implemented in a cloud based message broker system and we have designed it to scale on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS): a scalable cloud-service provider.</p>

<p>Androphsy has a very simple report generation module. It will export evidence to a .pdf file. The development is expected to improve the reporting module in terms of below suggestions.
Export evidence in multiple formats including .pdf, .tex,, .html, .xml, .csv
Well formatted report layout: You are free to use any open source reporting library under GNU license. Currently it uses iText.</p>
  <p>Report should support not only text, but also images: You are free to modify the existing reporting module in order to give a better solution.</p>

					<h2>Proposal 19: End-to-End Encryption of Android Phone Calls</h2></br>

<p>Mobile phones are regularly used to discuss sensitive personal and business information. However, little attention is given to the security of these conversations, which can be particularly important for international businessmen. Current encrypted phone call solutions for this problem require either an Internet connection for VOIP or a specialized handset. We want to develop real-time phone encryption module for Android operating system.</p>

					<h2>Proposal 20: Discriminatively trained deformable part models</h2>
<br/>
<p>Deformable part models is one of the famous object detection approach. Implementation of deformable part models object detection is open-source and accessible to everyone. Implementation include object detection and model learning code, as well as models trained on the PASCAL and INRIA Person datasets. It come with proceder to train models using your own dataset but the problem is building own dataset is very complex process. Objective of this project is developing a tool to building own dataset to trained deformable part models.</p>

					<h2>Proposal 21:  Smartphone Support for People who Stutter</h2>

<p>Stuttering is a very complex speech disorder that
affects around 0.7% of adults while around 5% of the population
have stuttered at some point. A large percentage of the affected
people tend to speak more fluently when their own speech is
played back to their ear with some type of alteration. While
this has been done with special devices, smartphones can be
used for this purpose. We report on our initial experiences on
building such an application and demonstrate problems with
delay caused by the lack of real-time support for audio playback
in the Android operating system. We also discuss ideas for future
work to improve app support for people who stutter.</p>

					<h2>Proposal 23:  Developing query parser for Senze language</h2>

<p>
						Main component of the MySensors platform is the Senzes which are very similar to twitter messages. These Senzes can be used to build various applications and integrated into the existing systems. Senzes are capable of expressing any kind of sensing to the target devices. In this project we want to develop dynamic generator and parser for Senzes language queries and responses.

					<h2>Proposal 24:  BASSA-Automated download queue</h2>
<br/>
<p>Bassa is a download queue where users can log in and submit their download as a link or torrent magnet link. Then Bassa will automatically download it in the night time and will inform the user that his/her download is ready. Then the downloaded files will reside in local server for limited amount of time based on other userâ€™s ratings, so anyone in the same organization can get the file without downloading it again.
Then after some time Bass will automatically remove the old files from server.</p>
